<h1>PHP Include/Require</h1>
<p>The PHP include functions enables you to attach files to other file thus creating reusable codes in the host documents. </p>
<p>These are scripts which were designed to functions in other to help the organisation of the document.
These functions are divided into four areas but essentially performs the same operation. </p>
<p>They are: include(), require(), include_once() and require_once(). 
With this we can organise our files and documents well. For example we can declare the header separately, the body and the footer and attach or include the to form a document.
</p>
<p>Include (header.php);</p>
<p>Include (body.php);</p>

<p>Include (footer.php);</p>
Most websites and apps are done in this manner because they are easy to manage and maintain.
