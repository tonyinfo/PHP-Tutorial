<h1>PHP Comments</h1>

<p>
The comments are used to make notes of what the coder or programmer is writing.  It is used to let others who are working on a project to understand what his colleagues has done.<br>  It also enables the programmer to understand or remind him of what he has done.  <p>When the computer is reading a program, when it gets to the comment, it will pass without reading it. In other words, the comments are ignored during program execution.
<p>There are two basic ways in which you can comment out some lines:</p>
</p><p>//Comment out single line. <br>
#Single lines can also be commented out in this manner<br>
<p>/*This is how multiple lines can be commented out. The choice will depend on what you want to achieve and how you desire to achieve them */</p>
