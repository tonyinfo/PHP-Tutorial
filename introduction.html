  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <h3>What is PHP?</h3>

  <p>PHP is a server-side scripting language which is used for developing dynamic and interactive web pages. It was developed in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf to allow him to link up the pages with the database.  PHP is an acronym for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" It is widely available and free to use. PHP runs on various platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X. It is easier to learn than other programming languages.
  The server-side scripting language means that the scripts are interpreted in the server.  When a user accesses the information in the server, the information is processed and released to the user through the browser.
  It is supported by most database management systems but the MariaDB and MySQL as linked to the PHP.  I will recommend that you learn some HTML, CSS and SQL before embarking on your journey.
  It is a loosely typed language in that you do not really have to define your data type and it will interpret  and convert where appropriate and process them.</p>


  <h3>Variables</h3>

  <p>Variables are memory allocation apportioned to the system to store data at the runtime.  It is donated by the $ sign.   A variable can be anything and can start from a-z, A-Z, _.  I show you examples: $name, $person, $john, $a-$z, $_var, $var and cannot start with $1-$10 and $-var.
  Now that we have seen that variables are just memory allocations we are now going to look at the actual data types in the PHP programming language: </p>

<h3>Data Types</h3>
      1. String <br>
      2. Integer <br>
      3. Object <br>
      4. Array <br>
      5. Float <br>
      6. Boolean <br>
      7. NULL <br>
      8. Resources <br>

  <h3>Explanations:</h3>

      a. String<br>
  The string can be said to be word or collection or phrase of words inside the quote.  An example is “Emma” or “Emma is a boy”. It can be product, name or sentence.<br>

      b. Integer<br>
  An Integer is a whole number which can be 1, -1, 10 or any number.  An Integer must not have decimal point.   Memory allocation for an integer is about two billion characters according to the type of machine used.  An integer can be between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.<br>


     c. Object<br>
  In programming, an object is treated as a part or information relating to a noun in other words, as an instance of a class.  Example of a Class of Persons which must-have properties as name, age, gender and so on and they are referred to as the objects.<br>


      d. Array<br>
  An array is a piece of variable which can store more than one related data.  For example, a class of students will have many names and they can be grouped together in an array for easy of processing.<br>


      e. Float<br>
  Floats are numbers with decimal points or the number is exponential. 1.7976931348623E+308.<br>


      f. Boolean<br>
  Boolean is used to test whether a condition is true or false.  The program will spool and present the most appropriate condition.<br>


      g. NULL<br>
  This is a variable without a value assigned to it.  The variable is empty and no value is assigned to it.<br>


      h. Resources<br>
  This refers to the calling of function and are not actual resources.<br>
